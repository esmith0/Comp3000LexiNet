# LexiNet: Prototype educational support web application
<h2> What is LexiNet? </h2>
LexiNet is the response to a study conducted on the impact of dyslexia on learning to code.
Research indicates that students with dyslexia make excellent coders, however do not have sufficient academic support to develop their skills.
LexiNet is designed to become a platform on which educators can upload their resources which can then be reviewed by students with dyslexia.
This model is designed to encourage development of inclusive resources.
